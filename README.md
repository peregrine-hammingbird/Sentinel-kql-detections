# Sentinel KQL Detection Rules

This repository contains a set of Microsoft Sentinel detection rules and KQL queries designed for real-world Security Operations use.  
The focus is on high-impact detection scenarios including brute-force, suspicious scripting, privilege escalation, and lateral movement patterns.

Each rule includes:
- KQL query
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- tuning guidance and false positive considerations

The goal is to demonstrate practical detection engineering capability and readiness for SOC/Detection roles in English-speaking environments.
